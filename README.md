# GraphQL + React Event Booking API

Following [Academind](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSJbGtTlrDami-tDGPUV9-w) series

Simple NodeJS + GraphQL + React + MongoDB application

.env contains:

```
# Set to production when deploying to production
NODE_ENV=development

# Node.js server configuration
PORT=3001

MDB=secretstringtodatabase

# String for token
TOKEN_SECRET=helloworld
```

Run both from `root` folder and `frontend` folder (as for now)

```
npm install
npm start
```
